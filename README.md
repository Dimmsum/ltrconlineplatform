# ltrconlineplatform

Project Overview

The Language Teaching and Research Center (LTRC) is the home for all things language at UTEC, Ja. A number of students have issues when it comes on to their academic writing and things of that nature. So, to make it easier for these students to reach out for help in an online space when they are unable to meet face to face, there is the LTRC Online platform. This program aims to:


Make the process of getting help in academic writing and things of that nature
Digitalize the paper based system currently in place but not replace it.
Give students who can’t come in person the same opportunity to seek help in a convenient matter.
Make managing meetings with students and helping them more efficient on the administration side.


Requirements
In terms of what the program is to do or it’s core features, it goes as follows:


Minimal SignUp
This small signup and login will take the students ID Number, First and Last Name and then ask them to enter their password just so that the students information can be managed more conveniently.


Categorization of Help
This feature 
will help filter and separate students according to their specific needs and display it on the admin side with all the needed information. 


Pick available slot from calendar
This feature will allow the administrative personnel to define what dates and times they are free to accept students. So a student can then pick a time slot convenient to both parties for them to meet online.

Generate Meeting Link
A meeting link specific to that date and time will be generated and displayed to the admin and specific to the user.
